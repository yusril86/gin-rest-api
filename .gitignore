# Dependency directories (except vendor/ if you manage dependencies manually)
# If using Go modules, the go.mod and go.sum files should be tracked.
# If using vendoring, the vendor/ directory should typically be tracked.
# If you are not vendoring and let Go modules handle it, you might want to ignore the module cache.
# For Go modules, usually no special .gitignore entry is needed for dependencies,
# as go.mod and go.sum are tracked and the module cache is outside the project.
